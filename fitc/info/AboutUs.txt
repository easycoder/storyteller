## About Friends In The Cloud

With the coming of the Coronavirus pandemic there is greatly increased social exclusion, as people are kept indoors for everything other than essential activities. This loss of human contact can be made up in part by the use of digital technology, giving people the means to stay in contact with others.

The focus of this Group is to help people who are not familar with Internet technology to gain experience and confidence, by providing a social network for them where they can ask questions and practice using the technology.

For some people there are some significant obstacles to overcome. Those who have never gone online often need help in the basics, such as finding a suitable device (a smartphone) and signing up for a data plan with their phone operator. For some, the whole concept of _data_ is alien and will need to be carefully explained.

Social distancing, as required to deal with the Coronavirus crisis, makes this a lot harder as it prevents the usual physical proximity and face-to-face activities we take for granted, such as when buying and setting up a new phone. So we will in some cases need to find imaginative and innovative ways to help people over that crucial first step, perhaps by providing phones already set up for a particular user and guaranteed to be sterilised before being posted through a letter box or left on the step.

Anyone reading this who feels they can - and would like to - help in their own locality should get in touch through the Group - see our Home page.

Let's get everyone connected!
