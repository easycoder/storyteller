# Storyteller

Storyteller is a toolkit for building multi-page, single-column static websites composed of text and images. All text is input in Markdown format so no knowledge of HTML is required.

Storyteller is one of the fastest ways to get web content up and running. Jobs such as on-line instruction manuals, with or without photos, can be put together very rapidly. All you do is copy a standard `index.html` file to your website then start adding content using Markdown. You can add some of the special Storyteller codes as and when they are needed. It's easy to create multiple pages that link to each other and Storyteller will supply a simple framework with Home, Back and Forward buttons, automatically adjusting the appearance if it detects it's running on a smartphone.
