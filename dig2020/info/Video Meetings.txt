## Video meetings

For our video meetings we use a system called Jitsi Meet. This requires no registration and it does not collect any personal information. On a PC it's just a matter of clicking a link or typing an address into your browser's address bar. On a smartphone you will be asked to download and install an app.

If you are reading this on your smartphone and would like to set it up to use Jitsi Meet in advance of joining your first meeting, tap this link:

[Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si)

On the page that loads you will see a welcome message, below which is a panel inviting you to start a new meeting. Jitsi will offer you a randomly-generated meeting name, which changes every few seconds. Or you can type a name yourself if you prefer, such as My Meeting. (Jitsi will remove any spaces.)

When you tap the GO button you will be invited to download the app (or open it if you already have it). Once installation is complete you will join the meeeting. Of course, you will probably be the only one there, unless you chose the name of an actual meeting.

That's all you have to do for now. When you are invited to a meeting you can tap the link and the app will open automatically.
