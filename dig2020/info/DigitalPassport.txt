## GMail - your Digital Passport

The Internet gives you access to websites all around the world, but you will often have to register with them to use some or all of their features. The one piece of information that uniquely identifies you is your email address, and increasingly we are all using Google to provide us with one.

Most people with an Android phone will already have a Google account. It's not impossible to use Android without one but you don't get access to the Play Store so the range of apps you can use will be severely limited. A Google account is just an email address at Google, of the form

`myname@google.com`

In recent years it has become simpler to open accounts with shopping websites, blogs and many other places. Instead of having to type your email address and give a password you just click the "Log in with Google" button. For this to work you must be already logged into Google in your browser. The registration process is then instant, with nothing to remember.

For this reason, we call a Google account - and its associated GMail address - your "Digital Passport". A passport lets you travel the world; a Digital Passport brings the world to you through your browser.

If you don't already have a Google account, be sure to get one now. Go to the [Google Home Page](http://google.co.uk) and click the link in the top right of the main window. If your browser is not currently logged in to any account the button will be a blue rectangle with the text "Sign in". If you are already logged in the button will be either an initial letter or a thumbnail picture. The registration process is pretty straightforward, but if you have trouble you can ask for help in our WhatsApp Group.
