## Welcome to this Group!

Are you new to the world of computing and the Internet? Maybe you know someone who is in self-imposed isolation and lacking essential computer skills, who would like to get connected? The Digital Inclusion Group is for you and it's for them.

## What we do

Our aim is to help you make better use of your smartphone, tablet or computer. We have a WhatsApp Group where members can chat or ask questions, and we will have regular video meetings where anyone can join in.

Our team can also offer private tuition using online video, where we can help you with specific problems outside of the usual Group activities. This help is offered on a pay-as-you-feel basis, where you decide how much value to give to the knowledge you have gained.

## How to join

Membership of the Digital Inclusion Group is free. To join, this is what you need:

 - a smartphone
 - a mobile phone number
 - access to the Internet, either through Wifi or by using mobile data.

If you would like to join the Group, send a text or a WhatsApp message to this number:

07979 343 087

and one of our team will get back to you with instructions on what to do next. Please note you can cancel your membership at any time. As for privacy, we do not maintain any personal data about our members.

## About us

The Digital Inclusion Group is run by a small team of people with varying skills, who are all able to give some of their time to help others gain those skills. The team is based in North Leeds, in the United Kingdom, but the Coronavirus pandemic means we are all isolated, no matter if we're in the same street of the same town or half-way round the world. The Internet can bring us together; if we're connected it make little difference where we are (timezones and languages apart, that is).
