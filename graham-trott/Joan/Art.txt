## Art and Craft

Some time after marrying Albert, Mum took to painting and wood carving and became quite accomplished at both. Here are some of her paintings, signed as J Woodhead.

This set is of the cottage at Sheldwich:

~clear~And here are the carvings. Eventually her eyesight started to worsen with the onset of macular degeneration, so she was never able to finish her long-term project; a chain carved from a single block of wood. I occasionally have a hankering to try and do that myself; maybe I'll get round to it before it's too late.

~clear~~img:Macavity.jpg:left 15%~Height: 41cm. "Macavity" was the only carving to have a name. It's her most substantial piece and has a "presence" that's impossible to ignore in a room. It was inspired by some cat sculptures we came across in the Burwash Manor craft shop, to the west of Cambridge, in about 2003.

~clear~~img:Hanging cat.jpg:left 15%~Height: 23cm. A jokey piece.

~clear~~img:Cod bone.jpg:left 15%~Standing 57cm tall, this was a magnified copy of a bone from a cod, that presumably remained after dinner one day. Mum was impressed by its elegance.

~clear~~img:Cricketer.jpg:left 15%~Height: 36cm. Mum carved this for George, who had at one time been a keen cricketer.

~clear~~img:Dolphins.jpg:left 15%~Height: 13cm. This was probably Mum's most accomplished carving; very sensual to the touch.

~clear~~img:Eagle.jpg:left 15%~Height: 15.5cm. Not as elegant but still a nice piece of work, capturing the essence of frozen motion.

~clear~~img:Statue.jpg:left 15%~Height: 22cm. This was done at about the same time as the eagle. Both are a little rough as Mum was finding it hard to handle the tools by then. Though the wood itself may have had something to do with that; they both appear to have been cut from the same piece.
