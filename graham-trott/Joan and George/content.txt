George Arthur Whyman was a colleague of my father during the Land Registry years in Tunbridge Wells. George, a few years younger than Dad, was married to Betty, a high-flying seccretary in an investment bank. They were a childless couple who loved to travel the world and could afford to do so. After they all retired they kept in contact as friends.

Betty developed Alzheimer's later in life. The only likely record I can find of the death of someone with that name is from 1983; it's certainly possible that was Betty. George then carried on living in the house they had built themselves then shared in East Grinstead, Sussex. Here's the only photo I have of them in the garden of that house.

Dad passed away in 1986, just 3 years after that presumed date, and Mum and George maintained contact at that time. George admitted later that he wished he had taken the relationship further at the time, but he left it too long and a few years later Mum had met and then married ~sid:Mum and Albert:Albert~ to become Mrs Woodhead. Albert died in 2001 or 2002 and later began to rekindle her friendship with George. He still had a keen interest in world travel but found it uninteresting to do it alone, so he asked her if she would like to be his travelling companion on a high-end cruise.

Over the next 8 years or so, Mum and George went everywhere. The places they visited included

 - South Africa
 - New York
 - Norway and the Arctic Circle
 - A World Tour
 - Queen Mary 2 Mediterranean cruise
 - Scilly Isles
 - Madeira
 - Ireland
 - Canada
 - The Danube

and everywhere they went it was first-class and 5-star, thanks to George's substantial retirement income.

Unfortunately, although I have all of the hundreds of photos Mum took on these journeys, she was not an accomplished photographer. There are virtually no pictures of the couple themselves and only a few of George, usually against anonymous backgrounds.

In 2006 I moved to Italy with my then wife Frances. In early 2007 Mum and George came to see us; here are a couple  of photos taken on the Roman bridge in Dolceacqua:

Later that year my marriage fell apart. Up till that point I had never been as dutiful a son as perhaps I should, but the tramatic events going on in my life made me call Mum much more frequently, where she acted as a sounding board and confidant. Over the next couple of years she provided a good deal of help for me to recover from the ongoing damage and fallout, including a loan to help buy a house. During that time, George and Mum were still travelling but starting to find it more difficult as they were getting older. They'd lost interest in trailing round cities and ancient monuments with a gaggle of other tourists and were looking for something more personal and less stressful.

In March 2008 Mum and George came to visit Anna and me at the house in Torri we'd just bought. It was my 60th birthday and they took us to the Vista Palace hotel that overlooks Monaco, for a slap-up evening meal. It's an impressive place; almost like being in a helicopter, and we had a corner table with dramatic views down onto the city as the evening closed in.

Later that year, George came up with a plan, being to take the next holiday in Europe and to take Anna and me along with them to act as drivers, interpreters and companions. For us it would be a working holiday; for them a way to continue their favourite types of holiday. We settled on Provence, a few hours' drive away along the Mediterranean motorway. This was to be the first of 2 similar holidays; see ~tid:Provence~ and ~tid:Sicily~.

In this video, Joan and George talk to Anna about living apart as an elderly couple. Filmed at Villa Carlotta, Taormina, Sicily in April 2011.
