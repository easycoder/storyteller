 Joan and Ron were married on October 7, 1945, a month after the end of the Second World War.

 ~img:Ron & Joan.jpg:left 25%~As far as I know their first house was the upstairs flat in Russell Avenue, East Barnet where I was born in 1948 and Malcolm in 1950. At some point in the next couple of years we moved from there to a semi-detached house in Elm Park, Hornchurch. It was probably also during this time that Ron took the Civil Service entrance examination and passed, so he left his job at Buck and Hickman to become a clerk in the Land Registry. This department was gearing itself up for a move to new offices outside London; one part going to Lytham St Annes in Lancashire and the other to Tunbridge Wells, in Kent. His job went to the latter location in 1955, about the time I was due to change from Infants to Primary school. For some time he would travel to Tunbridge Wells while we all remained at Elm Park.

Over the next ten years or so Mum and Dad improved the house considerably from its pre-war state. But the time eventually came to move on, this time to a newly built detached house within walking distance of the Land Registry offices. There Mum and Dad stayed until he retired in 1978.

### Retirement

With retirement at the age of 60, Dad was still young and fit enough to embark on something he'd probably dreamed of for years; having a house in the country built specially for him and Mum. The location was critical; Kent was probably too expensive, but I had moved to Felixstowe in Suffolk and showed every sign of remaining there for a good number of years, and Malcolm too was living nearby. So Mum and Dad looked for some suitable building land around Ipswich and found a plot just outside the nearby village of Hadleigh; half an acre of sloping land facing south. They designed a U-shaped property and had it built as a wood-framed structure. Not a grand country mansion, just a comfortable 3-bedroom bungalow, naming it "Nettles", after the predominant local plant growth.

I don't know whose idea it was to build a house; it's a pretty adventurous thing for an ex-civil servant to take on, but that's what they did. They lived on-site in a caravan during the construction period and spent most of each day taming a wilderness. The plot was at the corner of a farmer's field, unused for decades because it was the only part of the field that wasn't flat. In fact it was so far off flat, tractors had trouble getting up and down it, so over the years it had become a small wood. Mum and Dad decided to leave half of it as a wood and put the bungalow in the middle of the rest, surrounding it with gardens, vegetable plots and a small orchard.

"Nettles" was the project that consumed many of the next years. Between them they tamed the land, built a small tennis court, an orchard and fruit cages and installed a pool - nothing fancy, just an above ground round plastic tub.

They were immensely happy there, but nothing lasts forever and there was a cloud on the horizon. Dad had always had a shaky hand - I'd noticed it when quite young - and it turned out to be a warning sign that Parkinson's Disease was to follow. He gradually became withdrawn, and although still active tending his crops the spark was gradually going out. It became obvious that Nettles was soon going to be too much for him, so reluctantly, around 1984 they sold up and moved to a more manageable bungalow, next-door but one to where I was living in Felixstowe.

Although Dad was getting very withdrawn as a result of the Parkinson's and was shaky on his feet, Mum wasted no time in transforming the garden and rearranging the house to create a new kitchen, but their time in Felixstowe together was not to be for very long. My wife at the time, Frances, was involved with the local Amateur Dramatic group, who put on an annual show at the Spa Pavilion in Felixstowe, located at about sea level with the main town behind it at the top of a small cliff. Mum and Dad came to a couple of these events but in 1986, as they were making their way down the cliff path, which didn't have a handrail, Dad tripped and fell, striking his head on the path. He was rushed unconscious to hospital, where he remained in a coma for about a week until it became fruitless to continue with the life support system. He died at the age of 68. Mum took it hard and for the next couple of years grieved terribly. She tried all sorts of remedies, most notably golf, but the only thing that seemed to help was her own artistic talent, which came out in painting and in wood sculpture. She and Malcolm, who had moved around the country quite a lot, hatched up a plan to buy and share a house in the Medway town of Gillingham so the bungalow was sold. I had also gone by that time to a new phase of my own life, this time in Norfolk.
