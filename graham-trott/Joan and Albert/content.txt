After Dad died, Mum continued at the bungalow in Felixstowe, trying to find something to make her life worthwhile again. She and my brother, with his family, hatched up a plan to pool their resources and buy a house big enough for them all to live in. The area chosen was Gillingham in Kent, where they bought a good-sized house and rearranged it so Mum could have some downstairs rooms to herself.

Although the plan was not a bad one it didn't go too well. In situations like this, with elderly folk who tend to be rather set in their ways, it's best to have complete separation in the form of a granny flat rather than sharing important rooms. With 2 young boys in the family there were conflicts over everything from mealtimes to flowers damaged  by balls kicked about in the garden. They stuck it out for a couple of years then sold up. Fortunately the proceeeds were sufficient to pay for a pair of small terraced houses a few doors apart, in nearby Faversham. Once again, Mum set to with enthusiasm to transform her rather neglected property and bring it up to date.

To build a social life Mum joined FAVARA, the Faversham Active Retirement Association, which was run by one Albert Woodhead, a gentleman of about her age with a colourful history. Born in Sheffield into a very poor family and badly misreated by a step-mother after his own mother died, he joined the Royal Navy and served for many years as a steward. This training left him eminently suited to the role of "gentlman's gentleman" or butler. Albert took up service with the former wartime Minister of Power, Geoffrey Lloyd, later Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd, Minister of Education in the mid 1950s. There was some connection with nearby Leeds Castle, though I don't know what it was other than that Albert was a frequent visitor as driver to the Baron.

He was prone to lengthy but often entertaining recollections of his childhood and subsequent adventures, always delivered in the strong Sheffield accent he never lost. His tales of an appalling childhood were recorded and partially transcribed by Mum; I reproduce them on ~stid:Albert/content:this page~.

As two single members of FAVARA, Mum and Albert gradually drifted together and eventually married in 1984, selling Mum's terrace house in town and moving to Albert's terraced cottage at Sheldwich, a couples of miles away from Faversham in the Kent countryside.

The house and garden were both immaculate, a testament to the care and attention devoted to them by Albert over many years.

They lived there for a few years, but Albert developed a hankering for a new-build house, so once again Mum found herself following me, this time to North Walsham, near the North Norfolk coast, where they bought a compact link-detached estate house nearing completion. The move seemed a rather unlikely one given how lovely the cottage had been and I don't think Mum ever felt it was a good swap, but she made the best of it.

Albert's keenness to move turned out to be a symptom of oncoming dementia, which gradually became steadily worse until he had to go into a hospice in about 2002. The year or so leading up to this was very stressful for Mum; Albert was convinced he was about to win a lottery competition and was a sucker for scams of various kinds, handing out money to almost anyone who asked. Mum eventually managed to get a power of attorney and took away his credit cards. One of the final straws was one day when Albert disappeared for hours. Late in the day Mum received a phone call from a Saab showroom in Sheringham, some 15 miles away, where he was trying to buy a new car, convinced the money was already on its way to him.

In the hospice Albert faded rapidly and Mum became a widow for the second time.
