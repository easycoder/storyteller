## What's this website about?

These are my memoirs; everything I can remember that's fit to publish about myself, my parents and my grandparents. It covers only a small part of a much larger family tree but it's the part I know best. Other members of the family may like to fill in the gaps in my knowledge, contribute their own pages or create a similar website for themselves that I can link to from here. (See ~sid:info:Information~.)

There are few alive now who knew my grandparents. My mother left an old family photo album going back to the 1920s but there's nothing from Dad's side beyond what the few remaining family members can remember of 60 years ago. I wish I'd taken some interest in their lives while they were still around, but I guess like most of us, when I was young I was always too busy having my own life to consider asking about my origins. There would always be time for that later - but of course there isn't.

There's nothing unusual about my family. We are quite ordinary people but everyone's life deserves to be recorded rather than just forgotten and these memoirs are intended to preserve what can be remembered. Memoirs are things that are often associated with the rich and the famous, but we all have stories to tell, without which our descendants will know nothing about us. If only my grandparents had been able to record the highlights of their own lives the way we do now!

Some of these stories are incomplete - particularly my own, I hope. It's a surprisingly big task to remember or find all the facts, to choose photos and to organize it all. But I'm having fun doing it and along the way discovering things in my own memory that I didn't know were there.

#### Coronavirus note: I'm writing this at the end of March 2020, while the Coronavirus pandemic is still gathering strength. All my photographs are in my house in Italy, which remains inaccessible to me for the indefinite future. Assuming I survive, and that international travel one day becomes possible again, I will retrieve the photos and use them where appropriate in these pages. Until then I'll just get the text written ready for a later update.
