# The Geek's Progress

My lifetime interest - some might say obsession - with all forms of technology probably started when I was around 11, in 1959. Up until then my exposure to music had been almost exclusively to the classical variety, though I was aware that Dad also liked some popular stuff, most notably Eartha Kitt. However, when I passed the 11-plus and started at the Grammar school I discovered a whole new genre. Pop music arrived in the mainstream at about that time. The first record I bought, in 1960, was "Apache", from The Shadows:

I recall building a crystal radio set - that barely worked - and accumulating various cast-off radios. I started listening to Radio Luxembourg, the only station broadcasting non-stop pop music, from 7pm onwards in dismal quality on Long Wave. At the age of 14 my favourite record was "Island of Dreams", by The Springfields:

When I was 15 my parents bought me a small reel-to-reel tape recorder, which I used enthusiastically to build record playlists. I became quite adept at cutting and splicing audio tape. Around that time I started spending my meagre pocket money on electronics magazines, most notably Practical Electronics. So by the time I finished school 3 years later in 1966 I was quite well up on transistors and the rest of electronic circuitry, even if I didn't have a great deal of practical experience.

Being in university in London meant close proximity to the electronics component shops in Tottenham Court Road. My course was of the "sandwich" variety, which interleaved periods of education with work practice. My employer was the South-Eastern Electricity Board, where I joined engineers fitting meters, running power lines and maintaining substations. In one of my first work periods we were trying to locate an underground cable running to a house. We had a cable detector but it performed very badly so I collected some components and built a simple replacement that worked better, if not by very much. It was enough, though, to switch my interest from power engineering to electronics, somewhat to the dismay of my employer. I was soon designing and building amplifiers and loudspeakers in every spare moment.

During the early 1970s, Practical Electronics started to give increased coverage to digital electronics, with increasingly frequent mentions of a new-fangled device called the "microprocessor". I ignored this for a couple of years as a passing fad but the articles got more and more frequent so I eventually started to take interest. The early Intel devices were tricky to use as they depended on multiple power supplies and complex timing circuits, but in 1975 Motorola launched the 6800, which did away with most of the complexity. I figured it was time to jump in so I ordered some components and hand-wired my first computer. My life changed completely at that point.
