## Relationships

It took me a long time to start writing this page. I've been married and divored twice and cannot escape at least part of the blame for the failures. So there's a certain amount of shame and regret that has followed me through life. I've tried to document here the major events as fairly as I can. It may look like everything was a disaster but in fact there were a lot of good times too that are for some strange reason harder to write about than the crises. I find it difficult to write an account that's fair to everyone so I'll just stick with basic facts.

### Kay

My first wife was Kay - Kathleen Taylor. Her mother had worked with mine during the War and was one of the bridesmaids at my parents wedding. The two families kept in touch intermittently. Kay's parents were Dick and Edna; he was a bank manager, at that time a most respectable profession. Kay was about a year younger than me and we met occsionally over the years but a little more frequently when we were teenagers. I don't know if my parents - or hers - consciously engaged in matchmaking but there was eventually an implied assumption that we were destined to become an item.

And so it was in 1967, when I was 19, that we got married. My parents provided the deposit for a small flat in Penge and we applied successfully for a mortgage on the basis of my salary as a sandwich-coure student and hers as a trainee caterer.

I think it's fair to say neither of us was really ready for the commitment. We should have waited at least until I'd finished at university, but that seemed an eternity away and we were keen to move into our own house, something that wouldn't be permitted if we hadn't married first. Times were changing, but not that quickly.

I don't have many memories of that time. We didn't do very much together and gradually drifted apart. I think Kay had found herself a replacement for me, someone who she had been keen on several years earlier, but although I suspected an affair I was never able to prove anything. The final nail in our marital coffin came when I graduated. We'd been talking about moving house and my parents were keen to help my brother the same way they had me, so the idea developed for hin to buy the Penge flat from us, with their help. I don't think they ever put pressure on us to find somewhere to live but Kay saw it that way. At that time, houses were getting hard to find and we eventually settled for a bungalow in Brentwood, in Essex.

We'd barely moved in when it became obvious the house was in a very sorry state. Cheaply made, it was not a good purchase. Our relationship didn't improve and after less than a year Kay abruptly moved out. The subsequent divorce was a messy business, as they so often are, particularly as the house proved hard to sell and we eventually settled for a much lower value than hoped for. Maybe we got away lightly; a few years later I heard the house had been demolished.

Although I was only at the Brentwood house for a few years, quite a lot happened. When we moved in I had a Triumph motorbike - see ~tid:Miscellany:Miscellany~ - but we really wanted a car. So I sold the bike. Kay was disgusted at the low price I got for it; I know I'm not a good salesman but it probably wasn't far off right. With the money I bought a rusty Austin 1100, then wrote it off by driving it into a ditch. Rather than buy another car I ordered a kit of parts to make my own Moke-style vehicle based on what could be used from the Austin - again see ~tid:Miscellany:Miscellany~. Across the road the son of the owners was scrapping an old Vauxhall Victor, so we piled all the left-over parts from my build into the back of the Vauxhall and away they went. I then finished the kit car, but it wasn't the kind of transport Kay had aspirations for; no doubt this contributed to our break-up.

### Frances

When Kay left I was 25. Over the next couple of years I had a couple of girlfriends, the most notable being Julia, a girl 7 years my junior who lived over in Basildon. She was just leaving school to go to University and study German, a language I knew a little of. Her studies took her to a college in Saarbrucken, where I visited her on one occasion, but I was no match for relatively affluent German boys who could woo her with the language.

Then in January 1975 some old friends down in Orpington invited me to a Burns Night orgy. Yes, that's not a typo; a real-live orgy. With a few extra attendees such as myself not taking much part in events. I knew beforehand it was an orgy as they had one each year at that time. I wasn't greatly bothered about the orging but didn't want to miss the free food and drink. The formula was simple; provide plenty of booze and turn the central heating up to maximum. Outside it was a crisp and very frosty night but inside you'd never have known.

Another non-participant was Frances Kendall, the woman who later became my second wife, brought to the party by another of the guests. We were introduced then sat in a corner together, mostly ignoring the events going on around us. Since we got on so well we arranged to meet up again, and one thing led to another. Although she was somewhat older than me, with two daughters, we felt a great deal of affinity with each other, most notably because we were both recent divorcees. We were married 2 years to the day after we first met.

Frances and I spent 32 years together, working to raise the girls and build ourselves a decent life. Most of it was pretty good, but one or two things gradually built up and spoiled the dream. The first one was that I was dissatisfied with life as a BT engineer, finding it in many ways too constraining. While I was able to pursue my interest in computers as a hobby for many years, eventually the company decided it had the right to claim ownership of everything I did, unpaid and in my own time. My links with outside organisations were frowned upon and would eventually have become subject to disciplinary action, so I left the company before this could happen.

The second fly in the ointment was a desire I'd always had; to live in a foreign country. Several factors contributed to this desire; the weather and a general dislike of English parochialism among them, but most notably the desire to be fluent in another language. I'd learned French and German at school and our skiing and windsurfing trips together had taken us to Greece, Spain, Bulgaria, France, Sweden and finally Italy. When I found myself commuting between Norwich and Cambridge every day I decided to put the time to good use and play language learning CDs while driving. But which language? Because our next holiday was to be in Italy, that was the choice I made, and after that there was really no turning back. I now had my heart set on retiring to Italy.

Unfortunately, Frances didn't see it the same way, but she was unable to articulate her wishes fully. Like many people she was stuck in a mis-remembered past that she longed to re-create; a husband with a secure job; children and grandchildren to indulge and so on. But of the two, my forcefulness proved stronger than her resistance and we ended up buying a house in Italy, just as the 2007 financial melt-down was gathering pace.

We lasted just under a year at the house in Apricale. During this time we didn't communicate a  great deal. Frances would tell anyone willing to listen how unhappy she was at the life we'd begun and how it was all my fault for leaving BT 15 years earlier. I take no pride in admitting I weakened during this time, looking for someone who could help me process the disappointment I felt about the way things were turning out. That person could have been male or female and I was only looking for someone I could confide in; there was no need for it to have been an affair of the heart. As luck would have it, though, a few months later I met Anna, who lived a short way away and who was in an even more disastrous relationship than mine was turning out to be. After a stormy break up of both our marriages, my house went back up for sale, Frances moved back to England and Anna and I set up together in a rented apartment in Ventimiglia.

If I've learned anything from my history of marriage and divorce it's that for anyone but the most stone-hearted, regret is inevitable. However much I enjoy life as it is, there's a corner of me that regrets the way things happened. I blame myself for most of it; particularly my failure to obey my own wedding vows, "for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part". It's arguable that to have gone on with things as they were would have made neither of us any happier, but that's not provable either way. All I know is that it hurt at the time, still does when I think about it and always will do. It doesn't make me want to go and try to undo what happened; far from it. I just wish it wasn't there as a constant weight, however small, on my conscience.

### Anna

My life with Anna has been a roller-coaster from day one, when we got together on September 15, 2007. Although Anna had a job it turned out to be precarious. My resources amounted to a State pension plus half the value of the Italian house I'd just sold. My BT pension vanished in the divorce and we were in the middle of the financial crisis. With most of my funds I'd bought a small apartment in Torri, a tiny village about 8km from the coast at Ventimiglia, but needed a mortgage to do so. The resulting monthly payments exceeded any income we were able to bring in. This is a situation nobody would want to encounter.

Anna's separation from her abusive husband involved complexities compared to which mine were a walk in the park. When we got together he shut her out of their house and emptied all their joint bank accounts. Later on he refused to pay the mortgage, while continuing to live at the house, barricaded in so as to create the impression the house was empty. At through this period he would discover where Anna was working and pester her employers with endless nuisance phone calls, pretending to be all shorts of different people but with the constant aim of discrediting her and forcing her dismissal. In this he usually succeeded.

We were forced into a number of survival strategies. One was to start a business. We chose a model that was a hybrid between those currently available; an online cookware shop specializing in products for superyachts, hotels and big private houses, with an emphasis on providing a personal service. We set up buying accounts with a number of European equipment manufactures and wholesalers, all of whom were prepared to supply to order and not require us to keep stock. Although this model couldn't possibly work today we were partially successful for 2 or 3 years; we just about broke even or made a small profit.

At the end of 2007 we launched The Riviera Woman, an online magazine aimed at women on the Riviera. Although we had no particular focusa at the outset it gradually moved towards telling the stories of the people who lived in, worked in or had connections with the area. We started filming interviews and ended up making a couple of hundred in all; everyone from pop singers and sculptors to Monaco politicians and royalty. This gave us experience that we've been able to use ever since, but at the time it brought in no money. Anna became a well-known figure in the area and developed strong writing skills that she later applied to great effect in her career as a funeral celebrant.

The second strategy was to take Anna's husband through the Italian legal system, something we were told by everyone we met would only lead to disaster for us. We had two things going for us; he had emptied a joint savings account in the UK and he refused to acknowledge any letters. The first of these gave us a reason to take him to court; the second proved to be his undoing as he failed to realise that under Italian law, not answering implies agreement with any charges contained therein. After 5 years of to-ing and fro-ing we had a judgment that forfeited his half of their jointly-owned property. I was able to buy that half and after a few suggestions that his health might not be best served by hanging around, he finally moved out. There's been neither sight nor sound of him ever since; at the time of writing approaching a decade. We gained a great deal of respect for the much-maligned Italian legal system; it may be slow but it's thorough and worked well for us.

The third strategy was for me to get computer programming work in the UK. Over the ten-year period I was able to do this twice; a notable achievement for one of my age. On the first occasion, in 2011, the job was in Coventry. I rented a flat to live in locally while Anna stayed at our apartment in Torri. My pay was almost totally consumed by two mortgages - one on Torri and the other on Anna's house that her husband was occupying while paying nothing - and by the rent in Conventry, but it kept us above water. In 2013 three things happened; my mother died and left me a reasonable, if not spectacular, sum of money, I sold the Torri apartment and we won Anna's house back. So I left Coventry and came back to Italy to live in our now jointly-owned house. Our resources still didn't cope with the cost of living, though, so in 2016 I once again sought work and was lucky enough to get it. Interestingly, the job came from the same person who had interviewed me for the Coventry job 5 years earlier. This time it was a home-working opportunity that allowed me to work from Italy.

The Italian period eventually drew to a close. Following the Brexit vote, life was likely to get more difficult for expats like us. Then my hearing suddenly deteriorated after I caught flu. This made it much harder for me to cope with the daily online work meetings and I started to fall behind. Eventually I was "let go", to use the polite euphemism for being sacked. Thirdly, in spite of all efforts, Anna had not managed to earn a reliable income in Italy or France. Finally, Anna's mother in Leeds was having difficulty managing alone. So we made the decision in early 2018 to put the house up for sale and move back to England, where we would become carers for Anna's mother, living in her house.

That's the rough outline. As for the detail, that belongs in other parts of these memoirs.
