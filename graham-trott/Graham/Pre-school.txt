## East Barnet ##

~img:Here.jpg:left 25%~~img:Russell Lane.jpg:right 25%~I was born in London in March 1948 in an upstairs flat at 102 Russell Lane, London N20. Based on little more than this one photo I always imagined the house to be a rather grim, forbidding place but Google Street View reveals a pleasant leafy suburban avenue lined with respectable semi-detached houses. Initially I thought everything must have been knocked down and rebuilt at some point, but no, the house is still there and it now looks a lot brighter than my memory or the old photo suggest. It's funny how, having been brought up in the world before colour TV, I still have an impression of a world in black and white.~img:Russell Lane now.jpg:left 25%~With my old faulty memory now banished it now surprises me how little seems to have changed in over 70 years, and makes me wonder how many centuries these older houses are actually capable of surviving given a suitable amount of tender loving care.

~clear~~img:Baby me.jpg:left 25%~~img:Bathtime.jpg:right 25%~I think mine could have been described as a happy childhood. I seem to have been inquisitive and perhaps a little mischievous. My parents were keen to do everything properly so they gave me a good deal of attention and toys that were designed to develop intelligence, not just to provide a distraction. While Dad went out to work, Mum stayed at home to look after the house and family, as was the custom of those days. This full-time attention gave me an early boost, though I'm not sure I maintained it as well as I might have done.~img:Playpen.jpg:right 25%~I don't remember much about those days, just a hazy recollection of playing on the floor of the living room while Mum was doing the ironing. Everything seemed so big, but I suppose that's just the view of a 2-year old from floor level. 

When I was about 3 Mum started to teach me to read and write, giving me an advantage over most of the other children that helped me greatly once I started school. ~img:Broadstairs with Dad.jpg:left 25%~Money must have been tight in those days but we managed the odd excursion or two, usually to the seaside. Since Mum's parents had recently moved to Broadstairs and opened a guest house there, this was the usual holiday destination for most of my childhood, where I was able to satisfy my curiosity about every aspect of the beach.~clear~~img:Staircase.jpg:right 25%~My only clear memory is of the outside staircase at the back; a forbidding iron construction that led straight out from our flat down to the garden below. It had a dismal reputation; everyone except me fell down it at some point. Why I was spared I have no idea. My brother Malcolm tumbled pretty well all the way down but as he was only a toddler at that time he was able to shrug off the bruises with no lasting effects.

There are some dim memories of the arrival of Malcolm when I was just about to turn 2 years old, and I'm pretty sure my parents tried to adopt a little girl at one point but Mum couldn't summon the necessary emotional involvement. I also have a vague recollection of small dog appearing briefy on the scene; probably Mum's idea as she'd grown up with dogs, but that evidently wasn't successful either or it would have left more of an impression.

~img:Concentration.jpg:left 25%~Another thing comes to mind: the death of King George VI in February 1952. No, I don't actually remember the event - I was not yet 4 years old, after all. What I remember is Mum's exasperation with the BBC for taking Listen With Mother off the air. No doubt it was out of respect, those being proper times, but as she pointed out, how was a four-year-old going to know who the King was or why it mattered when he died? All I knew was my favorite radio program wasn't on and Mum was upset about it.

I believe I spent most of my pre-school years at Russell Lane; we moved to our first owner-occupied house in Hornchurch shortly before I was due to start school.

~img:11 Lancaster Drive, Hornchurch.jpg:right 25%~At this point I was approaching my first school days and the memories start to get a little clearer. This is the house we lived in nearly 70 years ago (as it looks today); I doubt it has changed much on the outside though I can't say I ever noticed what it looked like then. At that age, facts and experiences were more important to me than visual impressions. It was a quiet residential area, a short walk from the local infant school, and I remember being friends with a little girl of about my age who lived round the corner in a similar house, though theirs was grander as they were better off and had knocked the 2 main rooms downstairs into one. People who did that kind of thing were obviously important, folk to be reckoned with. It's odd that I have a faint memory of the inside of their house but none of my own; there must have been some envy at work there. I think they also had a car, whereas we didn't.

My first school was conveniently just up the road. At around this time my father had passed his Civil Service entrance exam and started work at the Land Registry, which was in the process of relocating from London to a new office in Tunbridge Wells, so while he travelled there on a weekly basis we remained in Essex. Later we moved from Essex to Southborough, near Tunbridge Wells, so my primary education was divided between these 2 locations.

~img:1955 certificate.jpg:right 25%~I only dimly remember my first few days at infant school. I hadn't a clue what it was all about and little grasp of time, so on at least one occasion Mum had to come and fetch me at lunchtime as I was too busy playing to remember to come home. All I remember about those early days was it was basically play; I don't remember when learning actually started. The early reading and writing with Mum gave me an advantage over my classmates so by the time I was seven I was consistently top of the class.
