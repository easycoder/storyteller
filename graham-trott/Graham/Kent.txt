## The move to Kent

I believe it was in 1955, when I was 7, that we moved from Essex to Kent. Dad had previously worked as a clerk with Buck and Hickman, a distributor of tools based in Tottenham Court Road (I discovered via Google that the company name still lives on and trades as part of a larger group) but the job offered only limited possibilities for advancement. The Civil Service was the place to be so he applied for and sat the entrance examination and on being fortunate enough to pass joined the Land Registry, which was just moving its offices from London to Tunbridge Wells.

~img:56 Yew Tree Road, Southborough.jpg:right 25%~We sold the house in Hornchurch and bought 56 Yew Tree Road, a solid 3-bedroomed house in Southborough, a couple of miles outside Tunbridge Wells. This is the house today, courtesey of Google Maps. At the time we moved there it was in a rather shabby state, with little maintenance having been done since it was built in the 1920s or 30s. We lived there for about 10 years, during which time Mum and Dad gradually improved the place. When we arrived most of the walls were clad in dark wood panelling, which I thought was rather classy but Mum hated and couldn't wait to cover with bright wallpaper. The main improvement, however, was to build an extension at the back to form a new kitchen, in the process removing the internal wall that bounded the traditional "coal hole". I suppose it must have created a downstairs toilet too, but I have surprisingly few memories of the inside of the house given how long I lived there.

### Primary school

~img:School photos.jpg:center 50% clear~For about half of the time we lived at Yew Tree Road I went to the local primary school in High Brooms. There was some confusion when I arrived in 1955 that was down to differences between the school systems in Essex and Kent, so I was wrongly placed in a class where all the other pupils were a year older than me. This might not have mattered but for my immaturity and I was rewarded a year later for my troublesome nature by having to retake the entire year. This sounds horrific now but as a child I had little awareness of what was going on. What my parents thought about it can only be imagined.

This being Kent, my parents' biggest fear was that I might not pass my 11-plus exam, which was the only way to get into one of the two nearby grammar schools. I was - and probably still am to some extent - generally disconnected from the world around me, a dreamer lost in my own thoughts, so it was hard to get me properly motivated or tell how well I was doing. The local "secondary modern" school had a pretty poor reputation as somewhere to throw students who didn't make the grade, and the head master at the time didn't believe in 'O' levels, never mind 'A levels', preferring to turn out shop workers and manual tradesmen rather than university candidates. Naturally, I had little idea of how serious all this might be as I was too wrapped up in my own imagination, but fortunately I passed the 11-plus and the following term started at the Judd School in Tonbridge.

### Holidays

During my primary school years we always took our holidays in Broadstairs, staying at Grandma and Grandad's guest house, "Southview". Mum's sister Jessie had never moved away and lived there with her removal van driver husband Norman, daughter Christine and sons Stephen and Paul. The oldest sister, Margaret, lived in Staines, in West London, with her photographer husband Ted and daughters Pat and Jennifer. They were right posh compared to the rest of us, with a big, comfortable car. ~img:7 grandchildren.jpg:right 25%~Occasionally all the family would get together in Broadstairs; here's all the 7 grandchildren together on the beach. Mum's caption suggests 1953 but I think it may have been a couple of years later. Pat (just visible on my left) and Christine (right) are both slightly older than me but there's less than a year or so in it, while Jennifer, Stephen and my brother Malcolm are all of a similar age, with Paul the youngest.

On a couple of occasions we were joined by James, the son of Dad's brother Victor. He's about 9 years older than me, so to me he was almost one of the "grown-ups".

Broadstairs was close to ideal for those times, with none of the distractions so common now. The beach was largely sandy but with areas of large pebbles. One of my favorite games was running along the beach, leaping from one pebble to the next. A missed footing could cause a painful fall but I don't recall that ever happening. Just below the high tide mark was the remains of a concrete construction, perhaps at one time a tidal swimming pool. With the tide out this was full of rock pools teeming with underwater species waiting to be discovered lurking in the seaweed by an expert 9-year old hunter. And in such a way childhood summer holidays passed blissfully.

### Transport

~img:Free car.jpg:right 25%~When I was about 11 Dad bought his first car; a 1936 Standard Ten. Already a quarter of a century old, at Â£50 it was all we could afford, and although Dad was probably very proud of his aquisition, Malcolm and I felt it labelled us as a bunch of hicks compared to uncle Ted in Staines, who had a Ford Zodiac that was newer, bigger and more powerful. So the unfortunate signage on the wall behind the car, that Dad didn't notice when he took the picture, was a source of merriment for years.

~img:Renown with caravan.jpg:left 25%~A few years later we were getting a little more affluent, and although we'd done a certain number of camping trips they'd always suffered one kind of disaster or another, mostly weather-related. so Mum and Dad decided to get into caravanning for holidays. Even though we ended up with quite a small caravan, towing it with the Standard Ten was out of the question; something bigger was called for. Hence the Triumph Renown, made in around 1950 and designed to look a little like a Bentley limousine. This was a sedate, roomy vehicle and only a decade and a half old; a total contrast to the old banger we'd had up to that point. The grand effect was somewhat spoiled while towing our far from new caravan but it served us for a number of holidays in trips to exotic locations such as Devon.

~img:Cleaning vehicles.jpg:right 25%~The Triumph was a huge lump of metal to use for everday getting about so Dad bought a little Garelli "Capri" scooter, probably 80cc. I don't think I ever went as a pillion passenger, but given he was a somewhat erratic driver that was probably no bad thing. Here are Mum and Dad (on separate occasions) buffing up the family transport. I was the proud owner of a Brownie 127 camera and these photos were taken by me when I was about 13 or 14.
