## Post Office Telecommunications

I joined Post Office Telecommunications in September 1971, 4 years before it was to split off as British Telecom and sail off away from the mother ship. The office I joined was not far from the Hall of Residence of my old Alma Mater, the City University, a short walk across and through the Barbican, that was expanding rapidly to absorb most of the City of London.

I stayed in this office for about 3 years, never being quite sure what my job was. It was something called the Long Lines Computer Project, which was highly ironic as far as I was concerned given my previous relationship with computers. At university the only contact I'd had was with the college computer, a ICL1900 mainframe, to which mere students could never be allowed direct access. We were confined to the corridor-like room next door to laboriously create our programs on punched cards. These we then handed through small hole in the wall to the white-coated priesthood waiting in the inner sanctum. We were then told to come back the next day, when the most common result was 500 or so sheets of blank paper with no indication of how or where the error had been made. This was hardly conducive to developing a love affair and I left university swearing I'd have nothing to do with computers. Ever.

The Post Office had other ideas, though. Working presumably on the "square peg in a round hole" principle they put me into one of the then quite rare computer departments, where after a period of utter confusion I came to realise that it had all been a huge misundertanding. We did love each other after all. The hardware was about as reliable as a Triumph Herald (a car of the sixties well known for only being able to travel a short distance before something fell off) but somehow I developed a liking for systems analysis and design, which is the part that happens just before the code monkeys apply their grubby hands to keyboards.

Having said all that I really had no idea what the project was supposed to achieve, but then few others did either. It was one of those things that happens in most companies, and it's called "an Initiative". The way it works is this.

Someone comes up with an idea for a new product, service or technique. It gets noticed by one of those glib salesman types who infest most companies; people whose main ability is to sell bullshit convincingly to their own bosses. This way an Initiative is born. It rises rapidly through the corporate hierarchy on a wave of market projections and strategy papers and is seen as Great and Good by those at the very top, who pour resources into it. The perpetrator also rises through the hierarchy at a rapid rate and after a couple of years is rewarded by being promoted to a plum job somewhere else in the organisation - but crucially well away from the Initiative.

It's at about this time that things start to go wrong. Any initiative based on little more than puff will run out of steam at some point, and if its pusher is really smart he (for it's usually a he) will have established some distance from it by the time it happens. In most cases it won't affect his reputation as he can blame all the problems on his successor; a fall guy who is just there to take the blame.

Now we enter the rescue phase, headed by someone with definite ideas on how to deal with the problems. This is usually somebody with no love for the project; his role is to enhance his reputation by embarking on a slash-and-burn policy while driving the staff to the limit to extract all the remaining value that can be taken, then closing the Initiative. He then goes off in a blaze of glory to do the same thing somewhere else.

The curious thing about all this is that two people advance their careers out of the same failed project. The same cycle of events happens over and over again and was once summarised as The Seven Stages Of A Project:

 1. Wild enthusiasm
 1. Disillusionment
 1. Chaos
 1. Search for the Guilty
 1. Punishment of the Innocent
 1. Promotion of the Non-Participants
 1. Definition of the Requirements

By about 1973 it was obvious to us PBI (Poor Bloody Infantry) that the project was going nowhere. As the downsizing continued I moved to an office in Holborn that dealt with testing telephones, in what was called the Development Department. In those days all phones were supplied by The Post Office and new models - of which there were very few - had to undergo a strict testing procedure so the Development Department was setting up a facility to do this in London.

At that time, the Post office Telecommunications Research Department was starting the process of moving out of its home in Dollis Hill, North London. Several locations around the country had been proposed and a poll was taken to see which one staff would like best. Naturally, the choice eventually made was the one least attractive to a high proportion of the (mostly London based) staff, being Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich in East Anglia. (It was rumoured that one of the directors had a house in the Suffolk countryside.)

~img:Adastral Park.jpg:right 50%~Research Department was also starting up a telephone testing facility and eventually someone noticed the duplication of effort. I was offered a move to Research Department to carry on doing much the same as before. My transfer happened at about the same time the facility in Suffolk opened so I spent only a few weeks at Dollis Hill before taking up a house rental in Felixstowe, about 8 miles away from the new office. This was 1975. Six years later BT split from the Post Office and in 1981 it became an independent state-owned company. It was privatised by the Thatcher Government in 1984.

I continued working on telephone testing but was growing increasingly keen on computer software. Although I'd been promoted once since joining The Post Office I turned down opportunities for further advancement, as I had no interest in becoming a manager commuting to London for meetings several times a week, preferring to remain hands-on with the development work. I eventually left BT in 1989 and moved to Norfolk to join a small computer company for whom I'd been writing software for more than a decade as a part-time activity, but that's a story for another page.
