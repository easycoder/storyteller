# Activities and Holidays

I was never one for a conventional package holiday, nor did I have the sense of adventure needed for the more exotic destinations. Cost was always a serious consideration. When young I went on holiday with my parents - see ~stid:Joan and Ron/Family Holidays:Family Holidays~ - and they too were very budget conscious, so this became the pattern for my own early holidays as an adult.

I married while still at university - then divorced and remarried a few years later - and there were many demands on our limited joint income. Early holidays tended to be camping or caravanning and it always seemed to be raining, just as it had done with Mum and Dad. We drove to the South of France one year to meet up with my parents, but few of the other destinations have left much in my memory, so they can't have been very exciting. One that stands out was a couple of weeks in Lanzarote in 1983.

In about 1978 I discovered ~tid:Windsurfing:windsurfing~, so several subsequent holidays were to places where I could indulge this new passion, either here in the UK or elsewhere in Europe. Again the Canary Islands were an obvious choice; first Gran Canaria then Tenerife. Much of the time was spent sitting on the beach waiting for the wind to blow and listening to tales of how wonderful it had been the week before I arrived. we also made 2 visits to Vassiliki, on the Greek island of Levkas, where the wind is almost guaranteed every day, and I achieved some degree of proficiency at high-wind sailing.

A few years after windsurfing came skiing, at which point we abandoned summer holidays completely and started winter breaks instead. These started in 1988 in Bulgaria, which we returned to a couple of times. On every trip I carried a video camera everywhere, but to be honest the footage is universally terrible and not worth showing. In 1997 we got together with 2 other couples and went on the first of several group holidays in various Italian ski resorts. The choice had been arbitrary and came down to value for money. We were a bunch with mixed ability and there was little point in booking a top French resort. In the end we all came to prefer Italy anyway as it was so much more relaxed and friendly. For these trips I took more care filming and ended up with a total of 8 videos between 1997 and 2003.

### Dubrovnik 2000

In 2000 and 2002 Frances and I went to Dubrovnik, in Croatia. On the first of these trips we flew from Gatwick to Dubrovnik and spent the week generally relaxing and visiting the local area, often by boat. On our way in our flight was running late and dusk was falling. Dubrovnik airport is built on the side of a mountain and has a frequent problem with a katabatic crosswind. Just as we were touching down the plane had to suddenly take off again. We ended up in Split, a 4-hour coach trip away up the Dalmatian coast. There was a certain amount of chaoe and as we waited for coaches to be found I have a memory of seeing the former Labour leader, Michael Foot, stumbling around in the dark with his minder. He was obviously a passenger on the same flight. I assume he made it safely to his hotel; we never saw him again that week.

The owner of the accomodation we were renting at Mlini, a couple of miles along the coast from the city, had a fast motorboat called "Vivado", which he used to ferry passengers around the region of Dubrovnik. It was very enjoyable to be flying across the water at high speed to be delivered to one of the local islands. When not travelling this way we walked along the coast, discovering bombed-out and abandoned 1970s hotels disappearing into the near-jungle. These were a reminder that the Serbian-Croatian civil war that broke up the former Yugoslavia had only ended a few years ealier.

### Dubrovnik 2001

Our second trip to Dubrovnik, at the end of August 2001, was overland; a journey of some 2400 miles passing through 8 countries, in a new Vauxhall Frontera I'd bought earlier that year. With 4 in the car plus all our luggage, an outboard engine and an inflatable dinghy on the roof, we made our way over two days from Holland via Germany into Austria, through the Karawanken Tunnel into Slovenia then to Croatia at the northern port of Rijeka. Here we drove onto a white-painted car ferry from Jadrolinija Lines, which took us on a 20-hour trip down the Adriatic to Dubrovnik. We'd booked a cabin and discovered inside it a UK 13-amp power socket. I'd already felt there was something slightly familiar about this boat and realized I'd been on it before, while it was still doing service as a cross-channel ferry back in the 60s. It's a small world. It was a hot journey; even at night the front of the boat

Once arrived we didn't use the car very much. I suppose we'd all had enough of travelling by then. We used the dinghy to explore the local coastline and to find secluded patches on a small island about half a mile out to sea. Once again we were at the same accomodation as the previous year and Vivado was still ferrying passengers to Dubrovnik and the nearby islands.

Our return journey started again with the ferry. From Rijeka we drove into Italy, past Trieste and Venice then heading up to Lake Garda and into the mountains. We stopped at Passo Tonale, where Frances and I had been skiing on several occasions, and took the Paradiso cable car up to the snowline where the national ski team practice in summer. After admiring the views we returned to the cable car, then continued to the ski resort of Bormio via the Passo di Gavia. This, at 17km in length, is one of the highest passes in the Alps and on the southern side is quite narrow, causing difficulty in passing larger vehicles. We were in a long line of cars coming up from Ponte di Legno and at one point a motorhome coming down had stopped in a vestigial lay-by to let the ascending traffic pass. The vehicle was perched almost of the edge of a precipice and we squeezed past it with mirrors retracted, just clearing the camper on our left and a rock wall on our right. As we passed I could see the occupants sitting with sheer terror in their eyes and no prospect of being able to move, probably for some hours. From Bormio it was Livigno then the Swiss border. In Switzerland we headed for Davos then Zurich, stopping along the way to find some overnight accomodation. In the morning we continued to Basel, crossing back into France for the run to the Channel.
