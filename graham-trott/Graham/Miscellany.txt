## Miscellany

This page is for things that don't belong anywhere else; a selection of odds and ends. I'll start with some tram tickets.

~img:Last Tram Week.jpg:left 25%~*Last Tram Week* was just that. In July 1952 I was only 4 years old and I dimly remember my Dad taking me for a ride on one of the last London trams. These iconic vehicles had been a feature of the city for 91 years and this was their last week of running. I'd been on a tram a couple of times, on visits to ~sid:Kate and Sidney:Nan and Grandad~, so it wasn't a complete novelty for me; it was the fact of it being the last time that stuck in my memory. I only discovered the tickets in late 2020, in a tiny envelope that had lain hidden among all my school reports.

Here in the BBC archives is a report about [Last Tram Week](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/6/newsid_2963000/2963092.stm).

## The Tiger 100

~img:Tiger 100.jpg:left 25%~When I was about 19 I was newly married and living in an upstairs flat on the edge of Croydon and Penge, in a drab area dubbed "Croynge" in the cartoon strip "The Perishers" published in the _Daily Mirror_. I was still in the motorbike phase as a car was too expensive to run. I bought a second- or third-hand Triumph Tiger 100, a 500cc twin-cylinder bike from around 1962; a model with a rather large, ugly fairing partially enclosing the chain and the rear wheel. Apart from looking like a dustbin the fairing made it a swine to get at anything behind, such as the chain, so I removed it at the earliest opportunity. At some point the swinging arm suspension bushes needed replacing and I was told this could only be done by removing the entire frame. So I stripped the bike down in my living room - much to the displeasure of my first wife - then after fitting the new bushes gave it a paint job and rebuilt it. For weeks the entire flat reeked of spray paint. At the time, the colour scheme I chose was considered rather naff when all other bikes were black, but looking back now I think I was just ahead of my time. The bike gave good service, even taking us to the South of France and back on a camping trip with everything piled high on the rear carrier.

~clear~## Eyore

In about 1973 I bought an old Austin 1100 and a few weeks later drove it off the road and into a ditch. When the tow truck pulled it out, one side ended up a fair bit longer than the other as it had only been held together with rust and glass fibre patches. I discovered a company in Southend called Ranger Automotive, who made body kits to take a pair of 1100 subframes, and set about building my own kit car, nicknamed Eyore for some unknown reason.

~img:Eyore-1.jpeg:left 25%~ ~img:Eyore-2.jpeg:left 25%~ Over the next few years I replaced pretty well everything. Both subframes were rusty, the suspension likewise, and I took out the 1100 engine and replaced it with a 1275cc unit with twin carbs, giving it quite decent performance. I moved the radiator to the front to overcome cooling problems and found a set of white leather seats from a Vanden Plas Princess 1100 in a local breaker's yard. All done very much on a shoestring, hence the lack of posh alloy wheels in the photos. I drove the car to the South of France one year and never really had any problems with it. Later I bought a more conventional car and Eyore languished in the garden for a couple of years before I sold it to a friend who smartened it up. He later passed it on and I heard it had gotten smashed in an accident soon after. I wonder what it would be worth now if it had survived.

## And...

Well this page is called Miscellany and there are some things we hang onto that defy classification. Many of these beg the question "Why on earth would you have kept _that_?" So with no apologies:

~img:Dad hair.jpg:left 25%~ ~img:Barney hair.jpg:right 25%~ When in 1986 ~sid:Ronald:Dad~ fell down a flight of steps without a handrail he went into a coma in hospital for a couple of weeks before life support was withdrawn. During that time I heard somewhere a mention of taking a lock of a person's hair to remember them by, so after he died we did just that. It's the one on the left.

The one on the right is from my old dog Barney, who died in 2002 at the age of 14 - quite old for a large dog. It seemed appropriate to take a lock of hair. The two are quite similar in texture.

~clear~~img:Wisdom tooth.jpg:left 25%~ And now avert your eyes. This is one of my own wisdom teeth, extracted when I was about 25. Why would I keep it? Why not?
