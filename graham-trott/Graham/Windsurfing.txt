# Windsurfing

Surfing has always been a thing but the idea of adding a sail only really took off in the 1980s. I'd heard about it and may occasionally have seen windsurfers off Felixstowe beach, close to where I lived, but it was only when a friend bought a board I started to take an interest. I was by then in my late 30s. I found a second-hand board; a truly terrrible item that was both heavy and incredibly slow, and went through the usual laborious process of learning to handle it. I became a member of the club that met every weekend on Felixstowe beach. Unlike many of the others I was never well-off enough to afford decent equipment; mine was always considerably inferior. Windsurfing is one of those sports where money really does buy you the best, and this was painfully obvious.

~img:Windsurfing-3.jpg:left 25%~Nevertheless, windsurfing became a passion for well over a decade and I got quite good at it. I was never keen on racing; my interest was in going as fast as possible in the highest winds I could manage. This was fortunately the cheap option; racing boards are expensive and fragile. Unfortunately, the better you get at windsurfing the fewer times you can find wind strong enough to fully stretch your ability.

~img:Windsurfing-1.jpg:right 25%~A friend in Felixstowe started building hand-made boards to order and in about 1985 I commissioned the one in this photo, with a design inspired by a quote from Cassius Clay (a.k.a. Mohammed Ali): "Float like a butterfly; sting like a bee". It was unusually small, with insufficient buoyancy to hold my weight unless moving, for which it required a good deal of wind. So the occasions I could use it properly were few and far between. However, here's one of me off a beach in Tenerife on a rare occasion when I found enough wind to get going properly.

~clear~On 2 occasions in the early 1990s we took summer holidays at Vassiliki, on the Greek island of Levkas. Here there is a wide bay facing south, with a long mountain ridge all the way down its western side. In summer the heat of the day causes an inversion effect to occur during the afternoon and a "katabatic" wind falls down the mountainside and out across the bay, giving ideal conditions for high-speed windsurfing. The wind, known to windsurfers as "Eric" is generally reliable so it's a good place for a holiday. Non-windsurfers are kept away from part of the bay owing to the danger of being hit by large lumps of plastic travelling at high speed.

~img:Windsurfing-2.jpg:left 25%~Owing to this danger it's not easy to get a good photo. Here's the only one I can find of myself, not going very fast as I'm about to land back at the beach. The conditions are unusual; very flat water at the upwind edge, rapidy becoming a short steep chop further out. A board travelling at any speed basically bounces from one wave top to the next, making turns difficult. On one occasion a sudden gust caught my sail half-way through a turn at a speed of maybe 20mph. The sail flipped onto the water and stopped dead but I carried on. Unfortunately the hook on my harness caught the harness rope and prevented the usual graceful arc, instead flipping me backwards onto the sail with a violent jerk. A potentially serious incident but apart from a bit of neck-ache no harm was done. ~img:RYA.jpg:right 15%~These were the early days of Club Vass, a British-owned board hire shop on the beach, also offering training for RYA (Royal Yachting Association) certificates. Here's my Level 4 certificate from my instructor, Roddy Coull, a Scot who was every bit as cool as his name demanded.

Since I was usually the one behind the camera, I don't feature much in my own video collection. Here's just about the only clip of me taken at Vassiliki in 2003. At least it gives an impression of the conditions - not the least how warm it was - and how busy it got.
