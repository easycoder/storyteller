## About this website

Everyone has a story to tell; the only question is where to tell it. In the past, people wrote diaries if they were able to, and some of the wealthier ones published their memoirs. Some of these documents survive only in physical form; others have been digitized.

Today we rely on websites to store all information and on search engines such as Google to find that information. The storage capacity of the Internet is effectively infinite, and in the world of business what goes in tends to stay there because it takes too long to sort out what is wanted and what is not. This doesn't necessarily mean everything in there can be found, only that it's in there _somewhere_. That's how things are in 2020 and the signs are that this direction of progress will continue.

It's not yet quite the same for personal websites, though. These have to be hosted somewhere and in most cases that incurs a cost. Given the small size of an average personal website I think the time will come when the cost of storage will fall to zero for these too, but we're not quite there yet. In the meantime there are a few places you can publish a website without having to pay an annual fee for hosting. This is of course quite important when it comes to memoirs, for these are documents intended to last beyond the lifetime of their authors.

At the time of writing the options for free hosting are fairly limited. Having looked around I have come to the conclusion that [Neocities](https://neocities.org) is probably the easiest one to set up and use. It offers both free and paid-for hosting and the free version comes with a limit of 1GB of storage; quite enough to host a fairly substantial private website, and it's the one I've chosen to host my own memoirs. Other possibilities are [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [DropPages](https://droppages.com/).

This website is built using Storyteller, a system for organizing text files written in an extended Markdown format. The system is fully documented at [its own website](https://storyteller20.neocities.org), and for anyone interested the entire source of the site can be found in the [Storyteller Github repository](https://github.com/easycoder/storyteller).

Storyteller is easy to use and anyone can build their own website with it. Most of the work is in writing the copy and finding the photos that will illustrate that copy. As with this website, yours can be hosted for free on [Neocities](https://neocities.org), where setting up an account is very simple.

### Customising this website

You may like to experiment with an alternative _theme_; that is, the border style of the page. Storyteller offers a small choice of different themes and you can choose from those currently available by clicking ~theme:here~.

Email enquires can be made to [the author of the system](mailto:gtanyware@gmail.com).
