## School days ##

My first school was just up the road from where we lived in Elm Park, on the eastern fringes of London. At around this time my father had started work at the Land Registry, which was in the process of relocating from London to a new office in Tunbridge Wells, and while he travelled there on a weekly basis we remained in Essex. Later we moved from Essex to Southborough, near Tunbridge Wells, so my primary education was divided between these 2 locations.

I only dimly remember my first few days at primary school. I hadn't a clue what it was all about and little grasp of time, so on at least one occasion Mum had to come and fetch me at lunchtime as I was too busy playing to remember to come home. All I remember about those early days was it was basically play; I don't remember when learning actually started. Mum had been teaching me to read from the age of about 3 and this gave me an early advantage over my classmates so by the time I was 7 I was consistently top of the class.
