## My Early Years ##

### Beginnings ###

~img:1.jpg:imageborder left pc25~I was born in London in March 1948 in an upstairs flat in Russell Lane, London N20. My recollection is of a rather grim, forbidding place but Google Street View shows this to be a pleasant leafy suburban avenue lined with respectable semi-detached houses. To avoid a flood of tourists I won't reveal the house number, though the present occupants may well recognise it from these photos taken in 1948. ~img:Russell Lane.jpg:imageborder right pc25~

I don't remember much about those days; there are some dim memories of the arrival of my brother when I was just about to turn 2 years old, and I'm pretty sure my parents tried to adopt a little girl at one point but Mum couldn't summon the necessary emotional involvement. ~img:Staircase.jpg:imageborder left pc25~

I also have a vague recollection of small dog appearing briefy on the scene; probably Mum's idea as she'd grown up with dogs, but that evidently wasn't successful either or it would have left more of an impression.

My only vivid memory is of the outside staircase at the back; a forbidding iron construction that led straight out from our flat down to the garden below. It had a dismal reputation; everyone except me fell down it at some point. My brother Malcolm tumbled pretty all the way down but as he was barely walking at that time was able to shrug off the bruises with no lasting effects.

I believe I spent all my pre-school years at this address; we moved to our first owner-occupied house in Elm Park shortly before I was due to start school.
