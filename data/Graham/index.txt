~img:GT.jpg:imageborder left pc25~My full name is Graham John Trott and this is my story. It's also the stories of my parents and their parents but that's as far back as living memory goes. There are few alive who knew my grandparents so their stories are now pretty sketchy. My mother left an old family photo album going back to the 1920s but there's nothing from Dad's side beyond what my brother and I can remember of 60 years ago. I wish I'd taken some interest in their lives while they were still around, but I guess like most people I was always too busy having my own life to consider asking about my origins.

There's nothing extraordinary about my family; we are quite ordinary people but everyone's life deserves to be recorded rather than just forgotten and these memoirs are intended to preserve what can be remembered.
