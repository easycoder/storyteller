Ronald George Trott was born on April 30 1918, in the final year of the Great War, in the industrialised dockland area of East London. His father, Sidney, was not in the Armed Forces as his was a reserved occupation in the docks.

Judging by the little he talked about it, Ron's childhood was neither typical nor very enjoyable. His mother, Kate, had been ensnared by an extreme Protestant sect and believed that all pleasure was sinful. There was no wireless set in the house, no books except the Bible and no family activities outside of the church. Ron and his older brother Victor had little time of their own as church attendance was compulsory every weekday and 3 times on Sundays. Socialising with friends was not permitted. 

In spite of this, Ron did well at school, qualifying for Grammar school, and would have made it to university but for family poverty. At the time he left school the world was still in Depression and opportunities were few.
