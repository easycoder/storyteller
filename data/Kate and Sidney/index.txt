Little is remembered about Grandpa Sid except that in the Second World War he was employed as a ships' tally clerk, a reserved occupation that prevented him from being called up. He could never have been accused of draft-dodging, however; given that he lived and worked in the East End of London this was hardly a safer place to be than on the battlefields of Europe.

In his later years he developed emphysema and became a somewhat silent, reclusive figure. Few photographs appear ever to have been taken.
