## Using Markdown in Storyteller ##

Markdown is a standard, widely used lightweight document formatting system. It’s possible you’ve encountered Markdown without realizing it. Facebook chat, Skype, and Reddit all let you use different flavors of Markdown to format your messages.

There are many resources on the Web that describe the standard syntax of Markdown. Try Googling _markdown cheatsheet_ or _try markdown_, the latter of which lets you try out various constructs and see the results.

Storyteller adds custom enhancements to Markdown, to do things that would be impossible otherwise. (They would be pretty hard to do in in HTML too, not to mention inconvenient.) For example, although you can easily define a link to another page outside the current one there's no standard construct that will tell Markdown you want to go to another Topic in the same Subject. So here's a list of our custom additions. Each one is text you put inside a pair of &#126; symbols. Please note that StoryTeller is a new product so more custom Markdown additions may be added over the course of time.

 - &#126;`sid:{name}:{link text}`&#126; sets up a hyperlink that looks like any other hyperlink, with a blue underline, but when the user clicks it the page changes to the Subject whose name is `{name}`. You can use the first part and leave out the second colon and what follows it; the system will simply use the same text for both.

 - &#126;`tid:{name}:{link text}`&#126; sets up a hyperlink that when the user clicks it the page changes to the Topic whose name is `{name}` in the current Subject. In this case the `.txt` part of the name is omitted. As with `sid`, id the colon and the second part are omitted the system will use the same text for both.

 - &#126;`img:{url}:{class}!{options}`&#126; Although standard Markdown has markup to add an image, this takes it further. The first part, `{url}` is the URL of the image. If this begins with `http` it's taken to be an external image at the full path given. If not, then it's assumed to be an image in the `images` folder of the current Topic. So the images for each Topic are independent.
 
 The second part, `class`, separated from the first part by a colon, is a list of space-delimited CSS classes you want to apply to the image, for example to have it float left or right, add a margin around it or whatever. In the standard StoryTeller package a CSS file is provided that has a number of simple classes to do some of these things.
 
 The final part is optional. When used, an exclamation mark is followed by a list of options. At present there is only one; `nolink`. The standard behavior of a link is to display it as a bigger image when the user clicks it. If you don't want this to happen, use `nolink`.

 - &#126;`clear`&#126; adds a 'clear', that forces all following content to be below anything already on the page. This is not usually an issue except where you use the `left` or `right` classes for an image, which causes text to flow around the image. Don't try to get the next paragraph to appear in the right place by adding blank lines, as this will not give the same resuts on all browsers. Instead, use a 'clear' before adding the next paragraph.

 - &#126;`select:item|item|item...  ...`&#126; specifies a drop-down list with as many items as you like, separated from each other by the vertical pipe (|) symbol. Each item is in 2 or 3 parts as follows:
 
 1. The first part is the _value_ of the item. This is either a Subject or a Topic; the value has S or T prefixed to indicate which. See the example below.
 
 1. A colon, then the text that will appear in the drop-down list for the item
 
 1. Optionally, an exclamation mark then a list of attributes for the item
 
 Example: &#126;select:-:Select a subject!selected disabled hidden|SFood:Food and drink|STransport:Transport links|SEntertainment:Cinemas, theaters and clubs|TMore:Other resources&#126;
 
 In this example, the first option is the current selected value, which is disabled and hidden so it shows when the selector is closed but not in the list itself. The next 3 items are all Sections and will take you there when selected. The last item is a Topic in the current Subject.
