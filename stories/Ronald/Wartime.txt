# World War II

It is a matter of some regret that we know as little as we do about Ron's time in the Army during the Second World War. I suppose we all assume our parents to be immortal and that there will be time later, then discover too late that this is not the case. All that remains here are a few basic facts, with a couple of anecdotes in passing.

~img:Soldier.jpg:right 25%~Ron's Army training took place at Catterick Camp, in North Yorkshire, then for much of the war he served in North Africa and took part in the Allied invasion of Italy. We are not sure if he made it as far as Germany before the war ended. He was in Signals, mostly driving a radio truck and operating the equipment inside. This must have been least sometimes a front-line role as he once mentioned being trapped behind enemy lines for some hours as the battle raged to and fro. 

Ron was not the typical big, bold and brash soldier. He was a small, slim man, modest and polite with a good education, more at home with a book than in the bar with mates. The Army demands unquestioning obedience and a black-and-white view of the world, and having spent all of his upbringings under the jackboot of a religious army Ron would have been less than keen on more of the same. However, he was fortunately not a rebel (these and other misfits got a very hard time in the wartime forces) so he followed orders, kept his pacifist views to himself and made the best of it. He eventually rose to the rank of Sergeant, which was pretty much as good as could be expected given his working-class background and lack of a University education.

Ron believed in the carrot rather than the stick, an approach that was rather at odds with Army training. On more than one occasion he was reprimanded for not shouting enough at his men (It's hard to recall him ever shouting, or even getting properly angry for that matter). His response was "They do what I ask so I don't need to shout", but the Army had little time for such displays of intelligence as it greatly preferred shouting.

## Wartime papers

A number of papers have survived from Ron's days in the Army. Though never rising past Lance Sergeant he was regarded as having exemplary conduct and was on one occasion 'Mentioned in Despatches'. Below are scans of all the papers. Click to enlarge. These are all high-resolution scans that can be right-clicked to download.
