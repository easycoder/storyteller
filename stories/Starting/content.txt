# How to start

Once you have downloaded Storyteller you need to copy it to your website. How you do this depends on the hosting you are using. One of the simplest is Neocities so that's what I'll describe here.

Start by opening a [Neocities](https://neocities.org) account. This is pretty simple; the main thing is to decide what you want to call your website and hope nobody else has already taken that name.

Once you have your name your website is live and can be seen by anyone who knows its name. All editing of your site is done in the Neocities online editor, so go into that. You'll see some standard files as supplied by the Neocities registration robot. You'll be providing your own files so you can delete most of them; all except `index.html`.

The first thing is to download a small zipped file from the Storyteller repository. Click this link:

[Storyteller files](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/easycoder/storyteller/download)

Click the `storyteller.zip` file name, then on the next screen click the `download` button to download the file onto your computer. Make sure you know where it is (probably in a folder called `Downloads`). Then find the file and right-click it. Click the option to unzip it. It contains 3 files:

 - index.html
 - theme.txt
 - title.txt

In the Neocities editor, click Upload, find the downloaded `index.html` and click `OK`, `Open` or `Upload` (it may vary according to your system).

Then click the button to create a new folder and type the name `stories`. Click its icon to go into the folder. Click `Upload` and look for the remaining 2 files from the Zip package; `theme.txt` and `title.txt`. Select these individually or together and upload them to Neocities.

You now have an empty Storyteller website. The real work starts now, to add all the text and pictures that make up your website.

As well as writing your stories you will probably want to choose the theme to be used for your site. A theme is a bunch of files that comprise the border round the content; you can see it here as the black scroll and the blue sky. There are currently 3 themes to choose from:

 - `storyteller` - the theme you see here
 - `herbal` - a border of what looks like short grass
 - `none` - no border at all.

Whichever one you choose, make sure its name is in the file `theme.txt`. Just that, with nothing else. Use the Neocities editor or update a suitable replacement from your computer.

The contents of the other top-level text file, `title.txt`, will appear as the title of the browser window while visitors are on your site. In the version from the Zip file it contains "Storyteller" so you'll want to change that to the name of your website.

Now you can actually start building your website. The way it works is that inside the `stories` folder you can have any number of _subject_ folders, each handling some subdivision of the pages on your site. Each of these folders has inside it another folder for any images that will be used by that subject, plus 2 text files:

 - `title.txt` - holds the text of the title that will appear at the top of the page (here it's `How to start`).
 - `content.txt` - holds the content of your page, which is text plus images, where the images are not directly embedded but are referred to by their names in the `images` folder.

The system always starts off by looking in the subject folder whose name is `home`, so create a folder called `home` inside your stories folder. Inside this create the `images` folder and the `title.txt` and `content.txt` text files. Click the `Edit` button for `title.txt`, type the title of your website and save it. Then click the `Edit` button for `content.txt` and type a couple of short paragraphs - anything you like just to test the system. Save this file.

Each Subject starts off with just the one topic (`content.txt`) but you can add as many more as you like. For example, if you want to write a page about a holiday in India you might call it `India.txt`. There'a full description of all this on our ~sid:Structure~ page.

Now you can view your website by clicking the big box at the top left of the editor screen or the site title to its right. Your content with the title you chose should appear in a new browser window. It it doesn't, look carefully at all the files and make any necessary corrections. On our ~sid:info~ page you'll see contact details if you need to ask questions.

Sometimes your browser may not notice you have made changes to your website and will continue to show you the old version. This is rather annoying and to get round it you will need to learn how to clear the browser cache. This process varies from browser to browser but Google will be able to tell you how to do it. Just search for _firefox clear cache_ or _chrome clear cache_ etc.

You can do all your editing in Neocities using their built-in editor or you can maintain a corresponding set of files on your computer and upload each one after making changes. If you understand the processes involved you can also run a copy of the website on your own computer by using the `rest.py` webserver provided in our [Github repository](https://github.com/easycoder/storyteller), which makes for a quicker way to make changes and test them before uploading to the live site. (You will also need to download `bottle.py` for this to work.)
