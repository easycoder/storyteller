## How to start ##

Once you have downloaded Storyteller you need to copy it to your website. How you do this depends on the hosting you are using. One of the simplest is Neocities so that's what I'll describe here.

Start by opening a [Neocities](https://neocities.org) account. This is pretty simple; the main thing is to decide what you want to call your website and hope nobody else has already taken that name.

Once you have your name your website is live and can be seen by anyone who knows its name. All editing of your site is done in the Neocities online editor, so go into that. You'll see some standard files as supplied by the Neocities registration robot. You'll be providing your own files so you can delete most of them; all except `index.html`.

The first thing is to download a small zipped file from the Storyteller repository. Click this link:

[Storyteller files](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/easycoder/storyteller/storyteller.zip)

Click the `download button` and download the file onto your computer. Make sure you know where it is! Then find the file and right-click it. Click the option to unzip it. It contains 3 files:

 - index.html
 - theme.txt
 - title.txt

In the Neocities editor, click Upload, find the 3 files, select them and click OK or Upload (it may vary accoring to your system). Check they all arrived inthe Neocities editor.

Then click the button to create a new folder and type the name `stories`.

You now have an empty Storyteller website. The real work starts now, to add all the text and pictures that make up your website.

As well as writing your stories you will probably want to choose the theme to be used for your site. A theme is a bunch of files that comprise the border round the content; you can see it here as the black scroll and the blue sky. There are currently 3 themes to choose from:

 - `storyteller` - the theme you see here
 - `herbal` ` a border of what looks like short grass
 - `none` - no border at all.

Whichever one you choose, make sure its name is in the file `theme.txt`. Just that, with nothing else.

The other top-level text file is `title.txt`. Whatever you put in here will appear as the title of the browser window while on your site.

Now you can actually start building your website. The way it works is that inside the `stories` folder you can have any number of _subject_ folders, each handling some subdivision of the pages on your site. Each of these folders has inside it a folder for any images that will be used by that subject, plus 2 text files:

 - `title.txt` - holds the text of the title that will appear at the top of the page (here it's `How to start`).
 - `content.txt` - holds the content of your page, which is text plus images, where the images are not directly embedded but are referred to by their names in the `images` folder.

Create a folder called `home` inside your stories folder. Inside this create the `images` folder and the `title.txt` and `content.txt` text files. Click the `Edit` button for `title.txt`, type the title of your website and save it. Then click the `Edit` button for `content.txt` and type a short paragraph - anything you like just to test the system. Save this file.

Now you can view your website by clicking the big box at the top left of the editor screen or the site title to its right. Your content with the title you chose should appear in a new browser window. It it doesn't, look carefully at all the files, compare the structure of your site with the folders on your computer and make any necessary corrections.

Sometimes your browser may not notice you have made changes to your website and will continue to show you the old version. To get round this you will need to learn how to clear the browser cache. This process varies from browser to browser but Google will be able to tell you how to do it. Just search for _firefox clear cache_ or _chrome clear cache_ etc.

You can do all your editing on the site itself using the built-in edtor or you can maintain a corresponding set of files on your computer and upload each one after making changes. If you understand the processes involved you can also run a copy of the website on your own computer by using the `rest.py` webserver provided in our [Github repository](https://github.com/easycoder/storyteller), which makes for a quicker way to make changes and test them before uploading to the live site. (You will also need to download `bottle.py` for this to work.)
