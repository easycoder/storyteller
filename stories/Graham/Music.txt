# My favourite music

I find choosing a list of favourite music a slightly daunting task. As with other things such as favourite film, colour or food, it varies from day to day. I don't want the same diet every day, nor to watch the same film over and over again, or to listen to the same music every day. So I'll start at the end, with the 3 tracks I would like to have played at my funeral. Does this seem strange? To me it's quite fitting.

### #1

First up is Freddie Mercury, and what better than "Who Wants To Live Forever", from the 1986 film _Highlander_. At this time he was already infected with AIDS and the end of his glittering career was beginning to come into view. Whether this song reflects the awareness of mortality so evident in later numbers cannot be known, but in any case it's a powerful piece.

There's no time for us  
There's no place for us  
What is this thing that builds our dreams  
Yet slips away from us?    
Who wants to live forever?  
Who wants to live forever?  

There's no chance for us  
It's all decided for us  
This world has only one  
Sweet moment set aside for us  
Who wants to live forever?  
Who wants to live forever?  
Who?    
Who dares to love forever  
Oh, when love must die?  

But touch my tears with your lips  
Touch my world with your fingertips  
And we can have forever  
And we can love forever  
Forever is our today  

Who wants to live forever?  
Who wants to live forever?  
Forever is our today  
Who waits forever anyway?

### #2

My second choice is "Still Crazy After All These Years", by the incomparable Paul Simon. It's an elegant, concise retrospective with beautiful lyrics.

I met my old lover  
On the street last night  
She seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh Still crazy after all these years  

I'm not the kind of man  
Who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on  
Old familiar ways  
And I ain't no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh still crazy after all these years  

Four in the morning  
Crapped out  
Yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should I?  
It's all gonna fade...  

Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage  
One fine day  
But I would not be convicted  
By a jury of my peers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh still crazy  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years

### #3

My third and final choice comes with a story. In July 1966 I was on holiday with my parents; a road trip across Europe to Austria then back via Italy and France. (See ~stid:Joan and Ron/Family Holidays:Family Holidays~) On the way we stopped somewhere in Germany and spent a couple of nights in  youth hostel. I remember nothing about that stop except that everywhere we went we heard the same piece of music playing from bars, restaurants and in the hostel; a haunting trumpet solo, the memory of which stayed with me ever since. Several times over the years I tried to identify the piece, which I took to be a particularly German thing since I'd never heard it in England, and I never succeeded. Of course, for most of that time there was no Internet, so no easy way to find this kind of information. All you could do was pick likely music experts and sing dah-di-dum-di-dah at them in the hope they might recognise the tune. Later, searches on the Internet for German trumpeters of that period came up with a number of names but no recording resembling that particular piece.

Then one day in November 2009 the BBC4 Time Shift series ran a programme called “The Last of the Liners”, a documentary about how the postwar liners gave way to cruise ships and travel by sea changed from being transport to leisure. An interesting programme in its own right but I wasn’t actually watching the TV when it started; I was in the computer room next door. What brought me in running was the first few scenes. Behind the presenter’s voice was that trumpet piece again, just as I remembered it, and a rush of old memories and impressions came flooding back. I stayed to watch the rest of the programme in the hope they might repeat the tune, but no, it was just that one scene.

This time, however, I wasn’t going to give up that easily; not with the resources of the World Wide Web at hand. I went to the BBC website and started searching for someone I could ask. Now I imagine the BBC must get an awful lot of emails and it’s difficult for them to respond to every crank and nut who blasts off a ten-page complaint, so they’ve basically pulled up the drawbridge. It’s actually pretty nigh impossible to find a “Contact Us” link that leads to a real person. There are a couple of forums but they get posts every few seconds (mostly about East Enders, it seems) so anything that isn’t picked up rapidly disappears into the void. And this was a question about BBC4, whose audience is much smaller, older and probably less likely to haunt forums than that of the main channels. Even Time Shift no longer has its own website and the trail ran cold.

However, the programme was re-run the following day so I recorded it then studied the credits and plugged the names of the producers into Google. And struck gold. The executive producer popped up in someone else’s FaceBook blog, a chess enthusiast telling his readers about a new programme being made where the producer was the chap I was searching for, and – most importantly – giving his email address at the Beeb. So  I wrote to him asking if he would be so kind as to help me identify the piece of music.

Within hours I had a reply from a production co-ordinator for the series, happy to help provide the answer I had been seeking for all those years. It seems that once you find a way past the front gate the BBC is populated by friendly and helpful people; truly a national asset. And then I discovered why my attempts to find a German trumpeter had failed; he was actually an Italian called Nini Rosso, and the number, “Il Silenzio”, was a hit in several countries including Italy and Germany. Of course, armed with this information the World Wide Web disgorges as much information as anyone could ask for.

Buona notte, amore    
Ti vedrò nei miei sogni    
Buona notte a te che sei lontano.

Good night, love    
I'll see you in my dreams    
Good night to you who are far away.

### Honourable mention

A close runner-up is "Ask the mountains", by Vangelis. This strangely haunting piece, with its barely discernable lyrics, always leaves me with a feeling of inner peace. One of the comments on the YouTube page says "_I always come back to this song when I wish to reconnect with the whole universe_". Another says "_I live and die at the same time... flying high on my wings each time I hear this! Thank you, Maestro Vangelis!_" That's about right.

Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Come  
Come  
Come  
Come  
Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Please don't follow me along  
When you read this I'll be gone  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Why couldn't this go on?  
Couldn't our happiness go on?  
Ask the sun that lightens up the sky  
When the night gives in, to tell you why  
Ask the mountains  
Wild woods, highlands  
Ask the green in the woods and the trees  
The cold breeze coming in from the sea  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and…

## Other favourites

I have a fairly wide and eclectic taste in music, though I'm not a fan of harsh, jangly jazz or folk. Neither am I keen on music with to much of an insistent beat, so that rules out most "pop" music as well as oompah. The piano is probably my favourinte instrument; solo guitar I find tedious and trumpets intrusive, though there are notable exceptions to all these, such as my third choice above. Lush orchestration and "pomp rock" sit somewhere near the top of my list. Queen, Pink Floyd and Genesis, definitely, while I don't much like shouty bands like Status Quo or heavy guitar rock.

I was brought up on classical music but seldom listen to it now, though there are pieces I still enjoy, particularly where classical merges into film themes. The [Warsaw Concerto](https://youtu.be/wbb-jozEdUQ), for example, and almost anything by Ennio Morricone, John Barry or of course Vangelis. The piano concerto is my favourite style of classical music, so Rachmaninov and Rubenstein are high on the list.
