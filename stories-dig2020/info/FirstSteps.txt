## First steps

Anyone familar with using smartphones, computers and the Internet may forget how hard it is for those who have no experience of any of these things to get started. All of the information they need is available online but they don't have the means to get to it. This is where we can help.

You may know someone - an elderly neighbour or relative, perhaps - who is suffering from the social exclusion brought about by having to stay at home all the time during the Coronavirus pandemic, cut off from all the social groups they previously relied on. This Group exists in part to help you help them.

In the current situation, social distancing make it impossible to do things that we used to take for granted, like popping round to someone's house to show them how to set up a new phone. Instead, we may need to do the job for them then deliver the phone ready to use, with instructions on how to turn it on. Each person's situation is different so it's hard to make hard-and-fast rules about this.

The minimum needed is a smartphone and an Internet connection. There is obviously a cost involved, for the device itself and for the data plan needed to use it. Members of this Group will already have solved these problems for themselves and will offer advice to others on the best deals, where to find a cheap phone and so on. So please join us and tell us all about the needs of the person you want to help. Just send a text or a WhatsApp message to this number:

07979 343 087

and we'll get back to you as soon as we can to let you know what to do next.
